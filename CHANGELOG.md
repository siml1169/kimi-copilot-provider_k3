## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added ESLint configuration using `typescript-eslint`.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow for build and lint checks.
- Added per-model `modelConfigs` overrides (temperature, topP, max tokens, system prompt, tool calling, etc.).
- Added `kimiCopilot.modelIdOverrides` setting to remap picker model IDs to custom API model IDs.
- Added secure API key storage via VS Code SecretStorage with plain-text fallback for migration.
- Added `Kimi Copilot: Test Connection` command.
- Added `Kimi Copilot: Edit Model Configuration` command.
- Added exponential backoff retry for transient Kimi API errors (429, 5xx).
- Added request latency logging.
- Added unit tests for message/tool conversion helpers.
- Added Prettier configuration and `npm run format` script.

### Changed
- Updated model registry to Kimi K2.x series: `kimi-k2.7-code`, `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed`, `kimi-k2.6`, `kimi-k2.5`.
- README updated to reflect the current model lineup and settings.
- Improved SSE streaming and non-streaming response handling.
- Improved error mapping for Kimi API HTTP status codes and network failures.
- `Kimi Copilot: Test Connection` now performs a real lightweight API call instead of only listing models.
- `top_p` now respects per-model defaults instead of being hard-coded to 0.95 for every model.
- Upgraded TypeScript `moduleResolution` from `node10` to `node16`.

### Deprecated
- `kimiCopilot.apiKey` plain-text setting is deprecated; use the `Kimi Copilot: Set API Key` command instead.

### Fixed
- Tool calling conversion now correctly accumulates streamed tool call deltas.
- System prompt is only prepended when the request does not already contain one.
- Fixed `Disposable` leak: configuration change listener is now properly disposed.
- Fixed model picker behavior in silent mode by returning an empty model list when `silent` is requested.
